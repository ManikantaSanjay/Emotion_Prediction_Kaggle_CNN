# Emotion_Prediction_Kaggle_CNN
## Facial Expression Prediction with CNN Model Architecture making use of Transfer Learning,Data Augmentation, Regularization Techniques.  

### Description :
The Kaggle Notebook uploaded here makes use of the CNN model architecture combined with Transfer Learning AKA pre-trained model,Data Augmentation Techniques and Regularization techniques to generate a accuracy of 63%.
The model built here is a prediction model which needs to label multi class dataset accurately.The model built here also makes use of Residual Blocks and Batch Normalisation Techniques.
### Dataset :
The dataset used here is Facial Expression Recog Image Ver of (FERC)Dataset.The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/manishshah120/facial-expression-recog-image-ver-of-fercdataset.
The dataset contains 7 labels namely: ['anger', 'fear', 'surprise', 'happiness', 'sadness', 'neutral', 'disgust'].
