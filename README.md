# Emotion_Prediction_Kaggle_CNN
## Facial Expression Prediction with CNN Model Architecture making use of Transfer Learning, Data Augmentation, Regularization Techniques.  

## 🧐 About 
i> The Kaggle Notebook file makes use of the CNN model architecture combined with Transfer Learning(Resnet-9).

ii> The model present in the notebook is a prediction model which tries to label a  multi class dataset accurately.

iii> The model makes use of Data Augmentation Techniques and Regularization techniques to generate a accuracy of 83%.

iv> The model also makes use of Residual Blocks and Batch Normalisation Techniques.
## Dataset 
The dataset used here is Facial Expression Recog Image Ver of (FERC)Dataset . ⬇️
